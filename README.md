# Predictive Modeling of Road Accident Severity in the UK: An Urban vs Rural Analysis Across Different Times
Coursework for module CASA006, while in the data folder you can find the three original datasets which will be used for merging the new dataset. Also, the geopackage for merging the final dataset.
**Please note** that the working environment is using the docker image jreades/sds:2023 more details about this docker image can be found from this link https://jreades.github.io/sds_env/setup/env.html
We have done the GridSearch for hyperparameter tuning for the random forest and Ada boosted decision tree model, however, running the grid search code may takes up to two hours so we have uncommentted the gridsearch code in the Jupyter Notebook. Instead, we have used the results achieved by running that code before directly for those two models. For reproducing the whole work completely, including the hyperparameter tuning, you will need to uncomment those code chunks. Instruction can also be found in the document. Due to the word limit, some instructions and demonstrations have been included in the comments in the code chunk.
